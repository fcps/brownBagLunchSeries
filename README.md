# Brown Bag Lunch Series
This repository will host materials used/referenced in the brown bag lunch series of videos being developed by the [Office of Data, Research, and Accountability](http://www.fcps.net/administration/departments/data) at [Fayette County Public Schools](http://www.fcps.net).  As the videos are released we will also try to keep a list below updated with links to each of the videos.

## Project Goal
Our primary goal is to provide our school leaders, their staff, and our community with answers to frequently asked questions in a more interactive format.  Additionally, when some questions cannot be answered quickly without making big assumptions about what type of training/knowledge exists in a topid, we want to provide the necessary foundational material to help.  For example, we cannot answer a question about point biserial correlation without the audience first having some familiarity with measurement scales and correlation more generally.  So, we are putting together videos to explain the different measurement scales and correlation.  Since those explanations are typically done with the aide of mathematical equations, we are also putting together videos that explain the different notation you may see (this way if you see it here or anywhere else the notation will not be as foreign - no pun intended).
