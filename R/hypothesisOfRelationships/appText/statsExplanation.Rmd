# Quick guide to interpreting the statistical output
* A correlation is a measure of the strenth of a relationship between two variables within a given population. As one variable (reading score) changes, what happens to the other variable (math score).
* The p-value is the probability that you would have found this result if there was in fact no relationship between the two variables, the correlation was 0.
* The line of best fit is a straight line that best represents the data. It will be able to give an idea of the strength and direction of the correlation.
