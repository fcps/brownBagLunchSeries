# Hypotheses of Differences
The Hypothesis of Difference is used to determine if two groups are truly different. One example would be looking to see if two groups, such as classrooms, had different scores on the same test. This involves more than looking at only the difference between the average scores for the two groups. The purpose of this application is to help build a greater understanding of the necessary parameters and how they interact to answer the question that you have posed.

# How to use the application
* Number of Observations - This will represent the number of students in each of our two groups. It is important to note that as your number of observations increase your precision increases, meaning you will have less variance.
* Average Test Score - This is your mean score for both groups. It is calculated by taking the sum of all of the scores for the group and then dividing by the number of observations. 
* Standard Deviation of Test Score - This represents how much the scores vary from the mean, a smaller standard deviation means that the scores are closer to the mean than in a sample with a larger standard deviation.
