# Viewing the raw data
* The data you see below are simulated using the values that __you__ set on the Use it tab.

* If you change the values of the sliders in that tab the values here will also change in response.

* Each row in the table represents a single student's test score and the group to which they belong.

* Although the values may not look exactly like the test scores you are most familiar with, the concept is the same.

* You can sort the data based on either column and can also set the number of records that will be displayed.

* These data for each group is simulated from a _Gaussian distribution_, or what you may know as "the Bell Curve".
